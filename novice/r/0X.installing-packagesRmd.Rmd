### Install new  functions (package management)

`install.packages("package-name")` will download a package from one of the CRAN mirrors assuming that a binary is available for your operating system. If you have not set a preferred CRAN mirror in your options(), then a menu will pop up asking you to choose a location.

```{r}
install.packages('dplyr')
```

Use `old.packages()` to list all your locally installed packages that are now out of date. `update.packages()` will update all packages in the known libraries interactively. This can take a while if you haven't done it recently. To update everything without any user intervention, use the `ask = FALSE` argument.

```{r updating, eval=FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

You can't ever learn all of R, but you can learn how to build a program and how to find help
to do the things that you want to do.
