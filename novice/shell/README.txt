For the Bergen bootcamp, instead of using the v5 material, we used material described in the shell_tutorial.pdf (or shell_tutorial.md) files, with the data from the shell/filesystem/users/uib/data folder

The v5 material from http://software-carpentry.org/v5/novice/shell/ uses these resources:

*   `filesystem`: filesystem used in "Files and Directories"
*   `creatures`: DNA data used in "Loops"
*   `finding`: data using in "Finding Things"
*   `molecules`: PDB files used in "Pipes and Filters"
*   `scripting`: files and directories used in "Shell Scripts"
